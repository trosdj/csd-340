            She wanted me to tell you she saw you dance. She said, when you were little, 
            you and her had a fight, right before your dance recital. You thought she 
            didn’t come see you dance. She did. She hid in the back so you wouldn’t see. 
            She said you were like an angel. She said you came to the place where they 
            buried her. Asked her a question? She said the answer is… 
            “<span id="every-day">_________</span>.” What did you ask?

            I just want to apologize to Mike’s mom and Josh’s mom and my mom. And I’m 
            sorry to everyone. I was very naive. I am so, so sorry for everything that 
            has happened. Because in spite of what Mike says now, it is my fault. Because 
            it was my project and I insisted. I insisted on everything. I insisted we 
            weren’t lost. I insisted we keep going. I insisted that we walk south. 
            Everything had to be my way and this is where we’ve ended up. And it’s all 
            because of me that we’re here now: hungry and cold and hunted. I love you mom 
            and dad. I am so sorry. … What is that? I’m <span id="scared">_________</span> 
            to close my eyes and I’m scared to open them. I’m going to die out here.

            Oh, this place... It should never have been a camp. Not for children. 
            They had so much trouble here. <span id="camp-blood">_________</span>. 
            You know a boy drowned the year before those two others were killed? 
            An accident? It was inadequate supervision. The counselors were not 
            paying enough attention... They were making love when that boy drowned.
