        <p class="intro">
            Howdy There! My name is DJ Trost, though some people know me as Toast. 
            <span class="sentence">Why Toast?</span> To make a long story short, it is very easy to misspell my last name.
            I am currently located in sunny Orlando, Florida; although, I am originally from 
            a very little town named Vernon, New York.

            If there was only one thing I thought you needed to know about me is my 
            love of all things spooky and horror, though, I’m not sure what’s to blame. 
            It could’ve been the fact that horror movies were a staple in my house growing 
            up, or that my father’s firehouse put on a haunted attraction every year. This love
            of horror does tend to find its way into all of my lines of work.
        </p>

        <p>
            When it comes to my work history, I have jumped around quite a bit, 
            although they all can be categorized as either Themed Entertainment, 
            digital media, or customer service. Currently I am an Attractions Host 
            in Asia Operations at Walt Disney World. That means I run the rides in 
            the Asia section of Animal Kingdom, that including Kali River Rapids 
            and Expedition Everest: Journey to the Forbidden Mountain. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Looking to the future, I have a few possible paths in front me. 
            First of all, I could stay with themed entertainment and work on ride 
            systems or interactive elements. Another path I’d enjoy is, data analysis 
            and visualization. I really enjoyed the analytics part of my previous work 
            in digital marketing and enjoyed studying database development. And finally, 
            I studied digital media production before my time at Bellevue so working in 
            the field of production tech seems like a no-brainer. No matter which route 
            I take I know I’ll be able to have a long a fulfilling career.
