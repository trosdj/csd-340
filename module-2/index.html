    Howdy There! My name is DJ Trost, though some people know me as Toast. 
    Why Toast? To make a long story short, it is very easy to misspell my last name. 
    I am currently located in sunny Orlando, Florida; although, I am originally from 
    a very little town named Vernon, New York.

    If there was only one thing I thought you needed to know about me is my 
    love of all things spooky and horror, though, I’m not sure what’s to blame. 
    It could’ve been the fact that horror movies were a staple in my house growing 
    up, or that my father’s firehouse put on a haunted attraction every year. This love
    of horror does tend to find its way into all of my lines of work.

    When it comes to my work history, I have jumped around quite a bit, 
    although they all can be categorized as either Themed Entertainment, 
    digital media, or customer service. Currently I am an Attractions Host 
    in Asia Operations at Walt Disney World. That means I run the rides in 
    the Asia section of Animal Kingdom, that including Kali River Rapids 
    and Expedition Everest: Journey to the Forbidden Mountain.

    Looking to the future, I have a few possible paths in front me. 
    First of all, I could stay with themed entertainment and work on ride 
    systems or interactive elements. Another path I’d enjoy is, data analysis 
    and visualization. I really enjoyed the analytics part of my previous work 
    in digital marketing and enjoyed studying database development. And finally, 
    I studied digital media production before my time at Bellevue so working in 
    the field of production tech seems like a no-brainer. No matter which route 
    I take I know I’ll be able to have a long a fulfilling career.
